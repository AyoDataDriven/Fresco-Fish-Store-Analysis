# Fresco-Fish-Store-Analysis
## Overview
Fresco Fish Store is an emerging retail business aiming to establish a strong presence in Nigeria’s dynamic fish market. To succeed in a highly competitive environment, the business must understand customer preferences, sales trends, and market behaviour that influence purchasing decisions. Informed insights are essential to tailor its offerings, improve service delivery, and attract and retain loyal customers.

This report presents prescriptive insights derived from a sales dataset of a Nigerian frozen food business, specifically focused on fish products, spanning the years 2019 to 2023. The goal is to explore and uncover market trends, customer behaviours, and operational patterns that can inform strategic decisions for Fresco Fish Store. By analysing historical sales data across regions, customer types, payment methods, and product conditions, the report aims to provide actionable recommendations that will enable the store to align with market demands and accelerate growth.

### Problem to be addressed 
As a growing player in the competitive fish retail market, Fresco Fish Store seeks to understand customer preferences, sales trends, and market behaviour to attract and retain customers effectively. However, the business currently lacks the strategic insights required to make data-driven decisions on product offerings, customer engagement, pricing, and vendor relationships. Without a clear understanding of market dynamics, there is a risk of misaligned inventory, inefficient sales channels, and lost revenue opportunities.

To bridge this gap, this project leverages data from the broader Nigerian fish market (2019–2023) to analyse key patterns in customer preferences, payment methods, sales conditions, and vendor performance. The insights derived will guide Fresco Fish Store in aligning its operations with market demands, optimising sales strategies, and positioning the brand competitively in the industry.
